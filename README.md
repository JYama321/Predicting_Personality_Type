Capstone project I completed as a student in the Data Science Immersive program at General Assembly

Title: Predicting Myers-Briggs Personality Types from Social Media Posts

This capstone project uses natural language processing techniques to analyze text postings on a social forum, and predict the writers' Myers-Briggs personality type using a classification model. It also compares personality types based on other factors such as the length, polarity, and subjectivity of these posts.

Techniques/Models used:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Stopwords, PorterStemmer, TextBlob, CountVectorizer
- RandomForestClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, OneVsRestClassifier, GridSearchCV
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
